# doc-handbook

* When building interface accessible by other apps/users, try stick to standards and schemas (e.g. swagger). Make the schemas discoverable, reference in README.md on oda-hub repositories.
* Follow [issue handling principles](https://github.com/oda-hub/doc-ops-reporting#issue-handling-principles) - in short, do not expect issues to be left unattended, never.
