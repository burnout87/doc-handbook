# Development Handbook


## General

* When building interface accessible by other apps/users, try stick to standards and schemas (e.g. swagger). Make the schemas discoverable, reference in README.md on oda-hub repositories.
* Follow [issue handling principles](https://github.com/oda-hub/doc-ops-reporting#issue-handling-principles) - in short, do not expect issues to be left unattended, never.

## Documentation

* write documentation **for purpose**, not just for the sake of it. State purpose (reason to write, who will read, when and why) in the b
* **writing extensive documentation is not excuse to write unclear code**. 
   * **Make your code as clear (and maybe not too "smart") as possible**, and complement with notes and comments explaining motivation when it is unclear - but do not use comments to repeat what codes does. 
* put **documentation near the code when possible**, when not - think hard what is the purpose of a separate note.
* make **references** to the doc and from the doc:
   *  **Make documentation discoverable! - i.e. referenced from known locations**. Not discoverable doc is all but useless and will likely be re-done unknowing. 
   *  not be afraid to put references to diverse resources, including restricted internal resources.
