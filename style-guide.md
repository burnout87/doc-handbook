# On the Style

Style is important for clarity of communication. For easy to read code and prose.
But, style may be quite subjective.

If every PR includes style changes, they end up cluttering the feature change - it makes more work in the reviews.
We should try to fix style independently (following the generally advisabe principle of one PR per feature).

Within the agreed style guidelines, there is some freedom on particular style choice. Let's be a forgiving and leave the changes made by the the original committer, unless the change is clearly an improvement. What is clearly an improvement should be evaluated very cautiously, and in unclear cases - justified.

## Code Style

is checked with CI. For python, let's use PEP8. 

## Prose Style

is checked with CI Vale.
